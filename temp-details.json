      "point": ["Converts AC to DC power.", "Regulates DC output"],
      "details": [" - The incoming electrical supply from overhead lines for signalling systems is usually AC. The SMR rectifies this AC into DC that can be used by the various electronic equipment.", " - SMR provides a regulated DC output voltage. This mean the voltage stays consistent even with fluctuations in the incoming AC supply, ensuring stable operation for the equipment."]
